🗓️ Day 5 – Exploring Pandas DataFrame
📚 Part of: 100 Days of Data Science Challenge
🧠 Objective

The main goal of Day 5 was to gain a strong understanding of Pandas DataFrames, one of the most important tools in data analysis. I focused on learning how to create, explore, clean, and manipulate data using Pandas to prepare datasets for further analysis.

🔍 Topics Covered
1. Introduction to Pandas

Learned what Pandas is and why it’s widely used in data science for handling structured data. Understood the difference between a Series (one-dimensional data) and a DataFrame (two-dimensional tabular data).

2. Creating DataFrames

Explored different ways to create DataFrames from lists, dictionaries, and external data files such as CSVs. Learned how to load data into a DataFrame and view its structure.

3. Exploring Data

Understood how to quickly view data samples, check the number of rows and columns, see column names, and understand data types. Also learned how to summarize data using descriptive statistics to get an overview of distributions and scales.

4. Selecting and Filtering Data

Learned how to access specific columns, rows, and subsets of data. Also explored ways to filter data based on certain conditions, such as selecting only rows that meet a specific criterion.

5. Data Cleaning and Manipulation

Focused on identifying and handling missing data, renaming or removing unnecessary columns, and sorting or reorganizing data. Learned how to make the dataset consistent and ready for analysis.

6. Aggregation and Grouping

Explored how to group data by categories and perform summary operations such as calculating averages or counts for each group. This helped in understanding trends and patterns within the data.

7. Merging and Combining Data

Learned how to combine multiple DataFrames through merging, joining, and concatenation. This is useful when dealing with data from different sources.

8. Exporting Data

Finally, explored how to save cleaned and processed data into new files for further use or sharing.

🧩 Key Takeaways

Pandas DataFrame is the core foundation for data handling in Python.

It simplifies data exploration, cleaning, and transformation tasks.

A clear understanding of Pandas prepares the foundation for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning workflows.
