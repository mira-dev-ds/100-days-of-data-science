# 🛒 E-Commerce Linear Regression Analysis (Day 4)

Welcome to **Day 4** of my 100 Days of Data Science journey!  
Today, I worked on a dataset from Kaggle that focuses on understanding **customer behavior** — specifically whether users spend more time and money on the **mobile app** or the **website**.

## 📊 Dataset Information

**Source:** [Focusing on Mobile App or Website - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kolawale/focusing-on-mobile-app-or-website)

This dataset contains details about:
- Time spent on app and website
- Session length
- Membership duration
- Yearly amount spent by customers

**Goal:**  
To predict the **Yearly Amount Spent** using features like:
- Time on App  
- Time on Website  
- Length of Membership  
- Average Session Length

## 🧠 What I Did

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded and explored the dataset using **pandas**  
- Checked for missing values and data types  
- Studied correlations between variables  
- Visualized data using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** (pairplots, heatmaps)

### 2. Linear Regression Model
- Built a **Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn**  
- Trained the model on key numerical features  
- Understood the meaning of:
  - **Coefficients** → Show how each feature affects spending  
  - **Intercept** → The base amount when all features are 0  

### 3. Predictions & Evaluation
- Used the model to predict yearly spending  
- Compared predictions vs actual values  
- Evaluated performance using **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error**

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**

## 🚀 Next Step

Tomorrow, I’ll explore **polynomial regression** or move into **multiple linear regression visualizations**,  
to understand how non-linear relationships can be modeled.
