# 🗓️ Day 6 – Data Cleaning

### 📚 Part of: *100 Days of Data Science Challenge*

---

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of Day 6 was to understand and apply various **data cleaning techniques** to prepare raw data for analysis. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data science project because it ensures accuracy, consistency, and reliability of insights derived from data.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

### 1. Understanding the Importance of Data Cleaning

Learned why data cleaning is one of the most time-consuming yet essential stages in a data science workflow. Real-world data often contains missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and formatting issues that can affect analysis and model performance.

### 2. Identifying Data Quality Issues

Explored common problems such as missing data, incorrect data types, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and duplicate entries. Understood how these issues can distort statistical summaries and visualizations if left unaddressed.

### 3. Handling Missing Values

Studied different strategies for dealing with missing data, including removal of incomplete records and replacing missing values using appropriate methods such as mean, median, or mode imputation. Emphasized the importance of choosing a method that maintains data integrity.

### 4. Dealing with Duplicates and Inconsistencies

Learned how to identify and remove duplicate records to prevent double counting or bias in analysis. Also worked on standardizing inconsistent entries, such as correcting misspelled category names or formatting dates uniformly.

### 5. Correcting Data Types and Formats

Understood how data type mismatches can lead to errors in analysis. Learned to convert columns into suitable data types — for example, converting strings to numerical or datetime formats when necessary.

### 6. Outlier Detection and Treatment

Explored the concept of outliers and how they can influence statistical measures like mean and standard deviation. Learned to detect unusual values and decide whether to remove or cap them depending on the context and business requirement.

### 7. Renaming, Reordering, and Structuring Data

Organized the dataset by renaming columns, rearranging them logically, and ensuring clear labeling. This step improves data readability and simplifies the later stages of analysis and visualization.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways

* Data cleaning is a **critical foundation** for trustworthy analysis.
* Clean, well-structured data leads to **more accurate insights** and **better model performance**.
* Effective cleaning requires both **technical skills** and **contextual understanding** of the data.
